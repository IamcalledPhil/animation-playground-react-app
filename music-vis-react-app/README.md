## Animation playground 

This app lets the user play around with animations to create their own dynamic art. This is built in React and uses Framer motion as the animation library. 

The user has four tools they can use to "paint" on the cavas. Each of these is a React component which returns a Framer motion component.

Run ```yarn start``` in the terminal to run locally.
